Hook Wine execv syscall to use special ld.so in order to make it fully relocateable- __WORK IN PROGRESS__

## Problem statement

We want to make a fully portable of 32-bit Wine that can run on any Linux system, without the need for 32-bit compatibility libraries to be installed in the system (which is a hassle).

32-bit Wine is needed to run 32-bit Windows applications (as were the norm until very recently).

```
5$ find . -type f -exec file {} 2>&1 \; | grep "ld-"

```

It would be best if we could rewrite the ELF executables to not search for `/lib/ld-linux.so.2` on the system (which is not there on most 64-bit systems), but in a custom location, e.g., in `$ORIGIN/../lib` which should resolve, in our example, to `./lib/ld-linux.so.2`. Unfortunately this does not work. [__Why?__](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48456169)

## Complication

It is possible to use a custom loader by invoking ELF binaries like this:

```
./lib/ld-linux.so.2 --library-path $(readlink -f ./lib/):$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./bin/wine
```

However, there are two issues with this:

- Wine launches subprocesses, which in turn would try to use `./lib/ld-linux.so.2` again
- `./lib/ld-linux.so.2` may still try to load libraries and [other stuff](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/i386/libc6/filelist) from the system `/lib`, which we must avoid. Ideally we could patch `./lib/ld-linux.so.2` to load its stuff from `$ORIGIN/i386-linux-gnu/`. Unfortunately there seems to be no way to achieve this apart from binary-patching `ld-linux.so.2`- __why?__

## Solution

See [winedeploy.sh](winedeploy.sh).

## Testing

```
wget -c https://github.com/probonopd/libhookexecv/releases/download/continuous/Wine_Windows_Program_Loader-3.5-x86_64.AppImage
chmod +x Wine*.AppImage
wget -c https://github.com/probonopd/libhookexecv/releases/download/continuous/wineprefix.tar.gz
tar xf wineprefix.tar.gz

WINEPREFIX=$(readlink -f wineprefix) ./Wine_Windows_Program_Loader-3.5-x86_64.AppImage notepad++
```
## Minimizing

```
mkdir squashfs-root
sudo mount -t tmpfs tmpfs squashfs-root/ -o strictatime,nodiratime 
./Downloads/NotepadPlusPlus-3.5-x86_64.AppImage --appimage-extract 

touch test

./squashfs-root/AppRun # Without existing WINEPREFIX overlay
./squashfs-root/AppRun # With existing WINEPREFIX overlay

find squashfs-root/ -mindepth 3 -anewer test -not -path '*/share/icons/*' -not -path '*/share/applications/*' -not -path '*/share/metainfo/*' 
find squashfs-root/ -mindepth 3 -not -anewer test -not -path '*/share/icons/*' -not -path '*/share/applications/*' -not -path '*/share/metainfo/*' -delete || true
find squashfs-root/ -type d -empty -delete
./squashfs-root/AppRun 
# Does it still run when thinned?

# Make minimized AppImage
ARCH=x86_64 ./appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage ./squashfs-root/
```

What if we need to use a local developer machine to determine the set of needed files but want to generate the minimized AppDir on a build machine? Use a `MANIFEST` file that specifies the wanted files:

```
# Make a MANIFEST (on a local developer machine)
( cd squashfs-root/ ; find . -type f -or -type s | sort | uniq  > ../MANIFEST )

# Delete everything from the AppDir that is not in the MANIFEST
( cd appdir/ ; find . -type f -or -type s | sort | uniq > ../ALLFILES ; diff --new-line-format="" --unchanged-line-format="" ../ALLFILES ../MANIFEST | xargs -r rm )
find appdir/ -type d -empty -delete
```
